# USD-to-RMB-Currency-Exchange-Rate-Prediction
@ Columbia University, 2017 spring
This is the final project for Data Science 4990. The final version of this project is a interactive web application that can allow you check historical rates, current rate of RMB-USD and Mexican Piso-USD, and the predictions for the next 3 or 7 days. However, the Yahoo! API doesn't work after the we gave the presentation. So, this part of code may need to be modified before running. You can check PDF file for a reference what we did for the project.
